## Encoding

### Instructions

The instructions are encoded in an intermediate language. Each instruction is encoded by a single byte, followed by arguments different for each instruction.

Argument types are noted in `name:type` notation where type is one of the following: `str`, `f64`, `u16`, `u8`, `u32`. The encoding of these types is described below the table.

### Types

#### `u8`, `u16`, `u32`

Each of these corresponds to a single, little endian encoded unsigned integer with either 8, 16 or 32 bits width.

#### `f64`

A 64 bit floating point number, encoded with **IEEE 754** *binary64* format, also known as `double`.

#### `str`

A literal string value with a maximum of 65535 bytes length. It's text is encoded in an application-defined encoding where all values below 128 must follow the ASCII encoding scheme. Values equal or above 128 are interpreted by an application-defined logic.

A string is started by a 16 bit unsigned integer defining the length of the string, followed by *length* bytes of content.

**Rationale:** The encoding is not fixed to UTF-8 as the language is meant to be embedded into games where a unicode encoding would be a burden to the player. Thus, a string is defined to be "at least" ASCII-compatible and allows UTF-8 encoding, but does not enforce this.
